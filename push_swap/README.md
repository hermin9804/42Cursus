## Because Swap_push isn’t as natural
Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions.  
To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.
